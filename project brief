Senior Engineering Project Brief
Project CARLOS: A Human-Safe, Compliant Actuation Testbed for Companion Robotics
Project Overview

Project CARLOS is a human-scale robotic research platform developed to investigate safe actuation, failure containment, and predictable behavior in robots operating in close physical proximity to humans.

The project emphasizes conservative mechanical and control design over performance-driven optimization, achieving safety through deliberate, hardware-enforced limitation of force, speed, and stored energy, rather than reliance on software intelligence alone.

CARLOS is not intended to demonstrate general artificial intelligence or high-performance manipulation. Instead, it serves as a systems engineering testbed for studying how robots can behave predictably, transparently, and safely when operating under uncertainty and partial failure.

Engineering Focus and Primary Contribution

The primary engineering contribution of this senior project is the design, implementation, and validation of a force-limited, compliant actuation subsystem suitable for human-proximate robotics.

This contribution includes:

mechanical design of compliant interaction zones

selection and justification of low-energy actuation methods

definition of conservative force and speed limits

integration of mechanical compliance with control-level safety constraints

validation of safe behavior under nominal and degraded operating conditions

The CARLOS platform provides system-level context, while the actuation subsystem represents the core technical deliverable of the project.

Design Philosophy

The system is designed using a “when, not if” failure philosophy, assuming that sensor noise, communication loss, component degradation, and human misuse are normal operating conditions rather than exceptional events.

Accordingly, the design prioritizes:

fail-soft mechanical behavior

predictable state transitions

safe default states

graceful degradation over task completion

explicit minimization of stored mechanical and pneumatic energy

Mechanical and control decisions are made to prevent hazardous motion even in the absence of correct software behavior, ensuring safety through physical design rather than procedural enforcement.

Mechanical and Actuation Design

Mechanical design emphasizes:

low-energy actuation

passive compliance where possible

intentional limitations on torque, speed, and range of motion

mechanical features that reduce injury risk during contact

Actuator selection is justified through trade studies considering:

force capability versus human safety limits

response time versus stability

efficiency versus controllability

failure behavior in powered and unpowered states

The resulting design prioritizes intrinsic physical safety guarantees over software-dependent enforcement.

Control Architecture

The control system follows a layered architecture, separating:

low-level actuator control

supervisory safety logic

behavior-level state machines

Autonomy is deliberately constrained. All behaviors operate within explicitly defined, mechanically enforced safety envelopes, and loss of supervisory control results in controlled shutdown or mechanically safe states rather than continued operation.

No control layer is permitted to command motion outside these physical safety bounds.

Safety Analysis and Validation

A Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is conducted throughout development to:

identify hazardous interactions

trace failure propagation paths

guide mechanical and control-level mitigations

Safety validation focuses on predictable containment rather than performance, including:

behavior under sensor failure

behavior during communication loss

response to unexpected human interaction

shutdown and recovery behavior

Validation includes quantitative verification of fault response behavior, such as automatic depressurization within a bounded response time following pressure sensor dropout.

Scope and Limitations

This project intentionally avoids:

general intelligence claims

high-speed manipulation

optimization for task efficiency

emotionally expressive or social robotics goals

The focus is on engineering correctness, safety, and reliability, not user experience or demonstration value. Any apparent simplicity of behavior reflects deliberate conservative design tradeoffs rather than limited technical ambition.

Outcome

Project CARLOS demonstrates how human-safe robotic behavior can be achieved through disciplined mechanical and systems engineering, emphasizing compliance, conservative actuation, and explicit safety reasoning.

The resulting platform serves as a research and teaching testbed for safe human-robot interaction and as a foundation for future work in industrial and service robotics contexts.

Prior Art and Disclosure

The architectural principles and safety concepts explored in this project are documented in a defensive technical disclosure published via Zenodo to establish prior art and ensure public availability of the core ideas.
