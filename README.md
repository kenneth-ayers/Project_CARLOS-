# Project_CARLOS
Project CARLOS is a human-scale companion robotics research platform focused on safe behavior design, failure containment, and reliable operation in close proximity to humans. The project explores a layered robotic control architecture emphasizing predictable state transitions, degraded-mode operation, and conservative autonomy boundaries rather than performance-driven optimization.

The system is designed under a “when, not if” failure philosophy, assuming sensor uncertainty, communication loss, and human misuse as normal operating conditions. Core development focuses on behavior-level autonomy implemented through explicit state machines, supervised control layers, and safe default states that prioritize human safety and system stability over task completion.

Mechanical design emphasizes low-energy actuation, compliant interaction zones, and intentional limitations on speed and force. Electrical and control subsystems prioritize observability, fault detection, and controlled shutdown behavior. A formal Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is used throughout development to identify high-risk interactions and guide mitigation strategies at both the hardware and software levels.

Project CARLOS is not intended as a demonstration of general intelligence, but as an investigation into responsible robot behavior under uncertainty. The platform serves as a testbed for studying how companion robots can behave transparently, predictably, and safely in human environments when autonomy is partial, assumptions fail, or operator intent is ambiguous.
